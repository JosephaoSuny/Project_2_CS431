Some of the short-comings of elixir include:
- having an immature ecosystem
    - Compared to languages with similar goals, like Ruby, there are very few packages
    - This is also because the language is very new
- Haing a small community
    - Elixir is a new language and does not currently have a large following
    - There are very few people writing Elixir, so it is hard to hire for
    - This is also because Elixir is a **functional** programming language
