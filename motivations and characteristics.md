Elixir exists as a modern response to Erlang, specifically it's weaknesses.
Elixir is designed to be easily extendable, comes with first class meta programming, and has "contracts" which mean data has to be able to do certain things.
This, complete with a better syntax than Erlang, has made it a loved language for highly scalable web apps.
